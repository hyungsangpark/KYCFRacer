# CodeRacer

Welcome to CodeRacer, a type racing game with code blocks.

This is a CS732/SE750 project repository for the group Fearless Frogs.

Link is as follows: https://fearless-frogs-project-webapp.herokuapp.com

## Description

CodeRacer enables users to practise the code syntax and familiarise themselves with the frequently
used algorithms by typing a block of code in a timed manner. CodeRacer not only supports
single-player mode but also has a multiplayer mode which encourages a competitive environment and
can be beneficial for users as it provides a challenge and promotes the enjoyability of the game whilst
allowing them to gain code-typing experience.
